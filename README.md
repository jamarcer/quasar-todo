# Quasar Todo (app)

A Quaser Todo app developed using a dockerized environment.

I followed de video [Create an App for Android, iOS, Mac & Windows - in 30 MINUTES!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV-D85D9KJQ&t=1132s) by Danny Connell.

## Prepare and run the environment in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then you can access to the application in your web browswer using the url: http://localhost:8080/
